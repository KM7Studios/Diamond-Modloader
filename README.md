# Diamond-Modloader
Diamond Modloader is a Minecraft modloader.

# *THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE NO CURRENT RELEASES YET.*

# Normal
-------------------------------
Get the Diamond downloader for the version you want, run it, and then you can play.

# Mods
-------------------------------
The mod directory is a bit different from other modloaders. This one is changed so you don't have to take mods out, instead it has a seperate folder.
Instead of "mods", it's "diamond_mods"
