# Diamond-Modloader
Diamond Modloader is a Minecraft modloader that has MCP compatibility.

# *THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE NO CURRENT RELEASES YET.*

# MCP
-------------------------------

Get MCP for the version you want to use, then get the Diamond MCP kit for that same version. Now setup MCP normally, and put the Diamond MCP kit into the src folder.
Now you can run it like normal.

# Normal
-------------------------------
Get the Diamond downloader for the version you want, run it, and then you can play.

# Mods
-------------------------------
The mod directory is a bit different from other modloaders. This one is changed so you don't have to take mods out, instead it has a seperate folder.
Instead of "mods", it's "diamond_mods"
